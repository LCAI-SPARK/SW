# Evaluating performance of a quantized model
> Taking resnet50 for example
## Frozen model
Before that, the pre-trained model needs to be frozen to remove redundant parameters. We provide a script to freeze the model, you can customize the output node by setting output_name according to your needs.
```bash
$ python3 frozen_model.py
```
## Preparing the datasets
Using [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/) validation dataset to verify the performance of a quantized model.
## Hyperparameter Description
- label_offset: Set the label offset, for the case where the first category of the model prediction result is the background, for example, the mobilenet prediction result are 1001 categorys , of which the first category is the background.
- calibration_samples: Set the calibration dataset size, the selection criteria should cover all categories.
- weight_scale: Set the weight quantization method; we add the implementation of per_channel based on the TVM implementation of per_tensor quantization, which can be used to compare the accuracy of aipu per_tensor and per_channel, using "channel_max" to achieve.
- target: Set different hardware backends. If it is set to "aipu" backend, you need to complete the FPGA board programming.
## Evaluating the quantitative model
```bash
$ python3 from_tensorflow_quantize_resnet50_v1.py 2>&1 | tee quantize_resnet50_v1.log
```
